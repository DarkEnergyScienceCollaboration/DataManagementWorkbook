      "A *Schema* is a special row in table that lists the content of every column in the record (name, type, etc). Routines can add new columns to the schema. Think of it as the top row of the table with the labels in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Tables* hold a *Schema* and an area of memory that holds records or entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you make a record in a table it produces a record in memory corresponding to what is in the schema and returns a pointer to the record.  You have to keep track of these yourself.  There is no way to iterate over the records in the table.  You need the pointers to do that.  So, mostly you won't use a table by itself unless it has just a few entries and you are tracking them yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Catalogs* hold a table and also a list of pointers that that point at the records.  You can iterate over those.  So, for most of the things where you want a data structure where you put entries in and then later loop over them or get things out you should use a catalog.\n",
