title:  Editing the software workbook

This website is stored in the same github repository as the iPython
notebooks of the tutorials are stored.  You can click on the "View it
on github" button to go to the repository.  The code for this site is
on in the "gh-pages" branch of the repository and uses the "github
pages" service.  If you switch to the "gh-pages" branch you can see
the files including this one.  The layout is done with CSS files
modified from the teach.github.org site.  The text of the site is
created in the "markdown" markup language for easy text editing.

In order to edit the pages you can either clone a local copy of the
repository and make the changes there or edit the files through the
github web interface but clicking on the file and choosing the "Edit"
button. As explained in the [Github
Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) documentation
the code is periodically rebuilt into a website.  This usually happens
quickly but, if you are making many changes in a short time period,
there is often a delay of up to several minutes for this to happen.
You can however immediately see the rendered markdown layout through
the web interface for the files if you so wish.

So, in short: to edit this web site switch to the gh-pages branch edit
the appropriate files there and commit them back to the repository.
